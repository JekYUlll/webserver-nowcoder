Shall I compare thee to a Summers day ? Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of Maie, And summers lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
And every faire from faire some-time declines,
By chance, or natures changing course vntrim'd: But thy eternall Summer shall not fade, Nor loose possession of that faire thou ow'st,
Nor shall death brag thou wandr'st in his shade,
When in eternall lines to time thou grow'st, So long as men can breath or eyes can see, So long as lives this, and this gives life to thee.
